Passport-aware Normalization
=======


This repo is implementation for the accepted paper "Passport-aware Normalization for Deep Model Protection" (NeurIPS 2020).

<p align="center"> Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed passport-aware normalization. </p>

The proposed Passport-aware Normalization is effective in both image and 3D point recognition models and robust against
different attacks, such as fine-tuning, model pruning and ambiguity attacks.


## Image Classification
In this task, we mainly refer to the settings mentioned in the baseline method "Rethinking Deep Neural Network Ownership Verification: Embedding Passports to Defeat Ambiguity Attacks"
 ([Code](https://kamwoh.github.io/DeepIPR/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07830)).
 


### How to run

Take AlexNet on CIFAR10 dataset as example, which is running on default arguments.
```
## cd Image_cls/Ours
```
#### Train a model with passport-aware normalization and triggers 
```
python train_v23.py -tb
```

#### Run Attacks

```
## Fine-tuning 
python train_v23.py -tb -tf
```

```
## Model pruning
python prun_v3.py
```

```
## Ambiguity attack I
python amb_attack_v3.py --type fake2
```

```
## Ambiguity attack II (10% flipped sign)
python amb_attack_v3.py --type fake3s  --flipperc 0.1
``` 

Experiment settings can be modified in  ./experiments/classification_private.py

Details about Passpor-aware Normalization can be found in ./models/layers/passportconv2d_private.py

## 3D Point Clouds Classification


### How to run
Take  [PointNet](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Qi_PointNet_Deep_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf) 
on [ModelNet](https://shapenet.cs.stanford.edu/media/modelnet40_normal_resampled.zip) dataset as example:

```
## cd 3d_point_cls
```
#### Train a model with passport-aware normalization and triggers 
```
python train_3_cls.py 
```

#### Run Attacks

```
## Fine-tuning 
python fine_tune2.py
```

```
## Model pruning
python prun3.py
```

```
## Ambiguity attack I
python amb_attack.py --type fake2
```

```
## Ambiguity attack II (10% flipped sign)
python amb_attack.py --type fake3s  --flipperc 0.1
``` 

## Requirements
Python >= 3.6 <br>
Pytorch >= 1.1.0
